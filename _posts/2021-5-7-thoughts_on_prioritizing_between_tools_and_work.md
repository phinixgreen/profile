The internet is literally crawling with tools that we can use to increase productivity. Does it imply that we should attempt to make the best use of 'All' of these tools as much as we can?

Here's my experience so far. I started out with notion and markdown, then github, then various other tools for academic writing. My realizations so far have been these -

- I tend to be be tool oriented in my work, rather than the opposite. Which means that I work because I like working with tools, not because I have to work. The upside is that I work as long as I feel like the tool is doing me favor. The downside is also the same. Many seem to call this, 'Shiny Object Syndrome'

- Learning one tool after another takes time. It paysoff in the longrun, it saves money and it can cost you money. I tried cheaper methods of productivity and still end up using expesive productivity software. Learning each tool, took a lot of time, from emacs to GUI based apps to mobile apps. It takes time. If I haven't got plenty of time to spare, I'd stick to one tool that I felt comfortable with. 

- Ofcourse it is hard to keep calm and carry on, but work is important. Work is what matters. No one, at the end of the day, will want to see how productive you've been unless there is a result. 

- Should we try to use all of these tools? It depends on the capacity to learn, really. Some people are comfortable with one tool, others need a whole ecosystem of tools. My approach was to learn one tool at a time, judge its pros and cons, and then either keep it in the toolbox or forget about using it again.

- When there's a lot of work to do, should I try to be productive or get to work first? The best bet here is to start working, and get productive as you go. When I say productive, I mean learning tools. Unless you start your work, you might not know what your needs are, therefore my suggestion would be to start with work first and then try to pin the specific needs that could be automated.

Automation is not everything. Imagine if robots did all your work. I don't know about you, but I'd be very bored. The point is keeping a healthy balance between tools for automating your workflow, and using your mind for work. I find I am most productive when I balance the two well.

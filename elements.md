		<p> Hi, my name is Muhammad Mustafa Monowar. A son of two respected government officials, I was born and raised in Bangladesh and grew up in Dhaka.
	<br>
	<br>
		I respect people who are sincere in their efforts, eager to learn about new things and value innovation. I often emphasize loyalty to the greater good, and the art of getting things done.
<br>
<br>
		I value honesty, trust and cooperation. I prefer mentorship over commandingness. I believe in deserve what is due, not more, nothing less.
<br>
<br>
		I am a muslim by religious beliefs. Bangladeshi by nationality, and cosmopolitan by lifestyle and network. I value saving resources where possible and planting trees. I am against killing animals for fun and luxury products and destroying natural habitat.
